# ShootTheFruit

#What it is/does
My project is called Shoot the Fruit, and it is a game where you can navigate using the arrow keys and shoot the fruit with limited bullets, and try to get a higher score. There are also different levels/ modes, allowing you to play with 2 players, or with different numbers of fruits :)

#Why I made it
I made the project to try to expand on another pixel/grid based game I made previously, using a smaller, more realistic grid and more complex features with 2 moving parts and trying to keep track of a lot more variables. I also made more modes and features to try and edit previous levels and make changes without causing too many glitches.

#How I made it
I mostly used JavaScript for the moving parts and programming, along with some HTML and CSS to make the visual elements.

#What I struggled with and what I learned
I struggled with a lot of the JavaScript since I usually use python, so the changes in syntax caused me to be stuck quite a lot. I also struggled with the overlaps of the elements and how a lot of time it caused random other colours to disappear which I spent ages trying to fix :(. In the end I learned quite a lot too, especially to improve efficiency (like the strawberry drawing compared to the apple drawing)
